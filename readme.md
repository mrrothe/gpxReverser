# GPX Reverser
## A Python script for reversing the tracks in a GPX file

I wrote this script as I often find walking routes which I'd rather walk in the opposite direction to the intitial author.

**Prerequisites:**

``` bash
pip3 install gpxpy
```

**Use:**

``` bash
python3 gpxreverser.py --input inputfile.gpx --output outputfie.gpx
```
